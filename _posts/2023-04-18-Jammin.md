The purpose of this assignment was to use the buzzer to play a song with an off and on switch. The switch should be able to turn the music from the buzzer off. 
My buzzer plays Hakuna MAtata using the code from [here] https://github.com/robsoncouto/arduino-songs/blob/master/thelionsleepstonight/thelionsleepstonight.ino 

One tip to my old self will be to make sure to have a proper if/else statement for the switch since I was having some difficulty with that. Also, 
shorter songs will have easier melodies that are easier to code (in case I use the buzzer for my project)
