This assignment was to generate random colors (red green or blue) only when the button is pressed. My tip to the future would be that the random led class example
is quite similar to this so it's helpful in understanding how to code the randomSeed(in case you forget in the future:))Also, it may not be as efficient, but listing
out pinMode (color, output) is easier for *me* compared to using for.
