## Description
My Project is called Sun's Out, BUns Out. The purpose of this project is to be able to detect the perfect short's weather. Using a temperature sensor, button, and RGB LED,
when the button is pressed, the sensor reads the temperature and if it's the ideal shorts weather, the threaded Sun design on the pocket will light up! 



My name is Mahalet Neguisse and I'm a First Year. My prospective major will be Art History.  I strongly encourage you to [watch this short video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s50vvwTystA&list=LL&index=44) - it's only 1 minute of your time.



## Some Problems...

Ideally, the RGB LED would light up, however, when creating the prototype I ran into a few problems. I short circuited my design (multiple times) before I realized and the RGB LED and light sensor stopped working correctly afterwards. Even when I connected it just to the board, it would not work. However, to keep the outputs and inputs, I just left it in. 
So, my project doesn't technically work. However, I believe my code and design would work if I did have the new components. 

## Revised Prototype 
Here's the revised prototype.

## What I hope to Learn 

I hope to learn how to code. It doesn't matter what I code or program as long as it's cool enough to brag about it. For example, I would brag about creating this website (even though we used a template, no one else has to know that) 



## Mahalet's Boring Fact of the Day 

I have one dog. Her name is Cutie. She is 13.
