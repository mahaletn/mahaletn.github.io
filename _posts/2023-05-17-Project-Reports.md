## Description
My Project is called Sun's Out, Buns Out. The purpose of this project is to be able to detect the perfect short's weather. Using a temperature sensor, button, and RGB LED,
when the button is pressed, the sensor reads the temperature and if it's the ideal shorts weather, the threaded Sun design on the pocket will light up! 


 ## Materials 
 Updated list: 
 -temperature sensor  
 -RGB LED 
 -conductive thread 
 -yellow non-conductive thread 
 -scissors 
 -cloth 
 -glue 
 -Arduino board
 

## Some Problems...

Ideally, the RGB LED would light up, however, when creating the prototype I ran into a few problems. I short circuited my design (multiple times) before I realized and the RGB LED and light sensor stopped working correctly afterwards. Even when I connected it just to the board, it would not work. However, to keep the outputs and inputs, I just left it in. 
So, my project doesn't technically work. However, I believe my code and design would work if I did have the new components.

 ## Tips 
 
1. My main tip would be to DOUBLE CHECK YOUR THREADS!!! If I had noticed where my threads were touching way before, I would not have short-circuited my components so badly they messed up. (The amount of smoke should've been the first red flag). I also should have double-checked my paper prototype since the way I drew the wires would not have been feasible on the actual shorts. 
 
2.Review your Arduino components. When making this design, I completely forgot the proper way to connect the sensors vs the button. Looking at the Review sheet of all the components became way handy (but too late). 

3. Practice sewing more. I like the way the sun's turned out on my shorts, but I think with a little more practice, I could have made it more intricate and cuter.
