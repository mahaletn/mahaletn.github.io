 The purpose of this project was to make two homemade switches to light up one LED on oour sewing project. I used a satinstitch of conductive thread and a piece of conductive fabric as my switches. 




## Tips and Tricks 

 My main tip would be to make sure you dont leave your battery on over night because my battery died so the light from the LED isnt as strong. I also reccomend using shorter pieces of conductive thread so you can conserve the amount used.
