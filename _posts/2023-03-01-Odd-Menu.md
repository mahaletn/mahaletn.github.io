This assignment was to have even number choice be the regular menu and odd's be the *secret* menu. Both menus have 3 meal chopices. This is good practice for nested ifs with constraints. 
My best tip would be to make sure you have brackets! You need more than you think.

(My output is grass because my number choice was odd, meaning its part of the secret menu. Grass is the last option choice for the secret menu.
