 
 The purpose of this assignment was to make a circuit plushy using a button, a slide switch, and 3 LED lights. I used a simple circuit to connect all of these parts with conductive thread and then regular thread to stitch up the plushy.
 My best tip would be to make sure the conductive threads dont overlap because then it can cause the electricity to go between those threads rather than the entire circuit.
