This assignment was to use a light and temperature sensor. When the brightness and temperature go below the minimum of your room, all red lights should turn on on the board and RGB piece. 

I was confused on whether the minimum or maximum should be set to 0 so testing out different numbers for your state varibales to see which one turns on when below the minimum helps a lot.
