My name is Mahalet Neguisse and I'm a First Year. My prospective major will be Art History.  I strongly encourage you to [watch this short video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s50vvwTystA&list=LL&index=44) - it's only 1 minute of your time.



## Experience

I have **zero** programming experience. I have a _little_ experience with sewing. 



## What I hope to Learn 

I hope to learn how to code. It doesn't matter what I code or program as long as it's cool enough to brag about it. For example, I would brag about creating this website (even though we used a template, no one else has to know that) 



## Mahalet's Boring Fact of the Day 

I have one dog. Her name is Cutie. She is 13.
