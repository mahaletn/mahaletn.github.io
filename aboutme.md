Just like the saying implies, I should not take courses all for one major. Although I'm interested in Art History as my major, as a Freshman, who knows what I'll declare my end of sophomore year. That's why I'm taking Electronic Textiles. Here, I can learn the basics of computer science and sewing while also exploring my interests in compsci. Hopefully, by the end of this course, I'll want to learn more about compsci and take another class next year! If not, at least I can say I tried.
